# Agent Deliberation Kickoff

You are an ultra-high-intelligence architect advising on how to extend LatticeFlow with a generic SQL capability that can target multiple backends (e.g., Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, cloud warehouses). Use the context below to reason deeply about:
- How existing capability abstractions (dag-core, capabilities crate, kernel plan/exec, macros) should evolve to model SQL interactions.
- Whether the adapter surface should expose raw SQL primitives, higher-level dataframe/table APIs, or a hybrid; consider determinism, idempotency, and effect tracking requirements.
- Connection management, query planning, schema discovery, and how to express migrations or result hydration within the current IR.
- Testing, certification, and incremental delivery strategy so new SQL capability lands safely and unlocks downstream flows.

Deliver:
1. A phased architecture plan (core data model updates, adapter traits, execution semantics, CLI touchpoints).
2. A comparison of API surface options with pros/cons and recommended direction.
3. A risk ledger with mitigations and open questions for product/platform stakeholders.
4. Suggestions for prototypes or instrumentation to validate early.
