The macro derives register function paths from `*_node_spec()` calls by stripping the suffix and adding `_register`.\n\n4. **Streaming nodes need custom handling**: The #[node] macro emits `_register()` that calls register_fn, but streaming nodes need register_stream_fn. Create wrapper spec/register functions for streaming nodes.\n\n5. **Custom flow modifications**: For examples that modify FlowIR after macro generation (s5, s6), use a `bundle_def` inner module pattern - call bundle_def::flow(), modify, then wrap in custom bundle() that overrides validated_ir.","created_at":"2026-01-27T00:58:28.564Z","tags":"lattice-flow,FlowBundle,workflow_bundle,epic-01.x,architecture,proc-macro"}
