Must provide shims:\n   - Custom `CancellationToken` using `AtomicBool` + `Notify`\n   - Custom `ReceiverStream` wrapping `mpsc::Receiver`\n   - Use `futures::stream::SelectAll` instead of `tokio_stream::StreamMap`\n\n3. **Target-specific dependencies in Cargo.toml**:\n```toml\n[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = \"wasm32\"))'.dependencies]\ntokio = { workspace = true, features = [\"full\"] }\ntokio-stream.workspace = true\ntokio-util.workspace = true\n\n[target.'cfg(target_arch = \"wasm32\")'.dependencies]\ntokio = { version = \"1\", default-features = false, features = [\"rt\", \"time\", \"sync\", \"macros\"] }\n```\n\n4. **Deterministic rejection**: Use `check_spill_support()` with two impls - one that allows everything (native with spill-fs) and one that rejects spill configs with clear error (wasm without spill-fs).\n\n5. **Cascading error handling**: New error variants like `ExecutionError::UnsupportedSpill` must be handled in all crates that match on the error type (e.g., host-web-axum).","created_at":"2026-01-27T18:47:10.117Z","tags":"lattice-flow,wasm,kernel-exec,epic-02.1,tokio,feature-gating"}

{"id":"mem-f9df052e3ad84bab","information":"Epic 02.2 host-workers implementation patterns for lattice-flow:\n\n1. **Worker crate integration**: Use worker crate v0.7.x with #[event(fetch)] for entry point. Add `use worker::event;` under #[cfg(target_arch = \"wasm32\")].\n\n2. **Dependency gating for wasm**: host-inproc needed target-specific kernel-exec dependency to avoid pulling tokio/mio on wasm:\n```toml\n[target.'cfg(target_arch = \"wasm32\")'.dependencies]\nkernel-exec = { path = \"../kernel-exec\", default-features = false, features = [\"wasm\"] }\n```\n\n3. **Futures pinning for select!**: HostRuntime::execute() returns a future that doesn't implement Unpin. Use `futures::pin_mut!` before `futures::select!`:\n```rust\nuse futures::pin_mut;\nlet exec_future = runtime.execute(invocation).fuse();\npin_mut!(exec_future);\n```\n\n4. **Extern blocks on wasm32**: Rust 2024 requires `unsafe extern \"Rust\"` for extern blocks.\n\n5. **Method temp lifetime**: `req.method().as_ref()` creates a temporary that doesn't live long enough. Bind the Method first: `let method = req.method(); let method_str = method.as_ref();`\n\n6. **Cancellation pattern**: Use custom AbortBridge/AbortListener with AtomicBool + Notify instead of tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken (not available on wasm).","created_at":"2026-01-27T19:24:33.041Z","tags":"lattice-flow,host-workers,cloudflare,wasm,epic-02.2,worker-rs"}
