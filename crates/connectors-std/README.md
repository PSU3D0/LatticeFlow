# connectors-std

`connectors-std` aggregates the first-party connectors that ship with Lattice (Stripe, SendGrid, Slack, etc.). It re-exports connector crates and provides curated packs for common domains.

## Surface
- Feature-gated re-exports for each provider-specific connector crate.
- Shared test fixtures and utilities across connectors.
- Documentation and metadata used by `flows template` scaffolding.

## Next steps
- Scaffold provider-specific crates (e.g., `connectors/stripe`, `connectors/sendgrid`).
- Integrate generated code from `connector-spec` and add contract tests per connector.
- Provide docs and metadata consumed by the registry and Studio.

## Depends on
- `dag-core`, `capabilities`, and capability adapters (HTTP, dedupe, etc.).
- Connector specs generated by `connector-spec`.
